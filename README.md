This is really messy code that I use to control the lighting in my house.

It's really bad.

### Features:

  - interactive readline shell
  - pain
  - control color/brightness/power per light or per group
  - list lights
  - list groups
  - list scenes
  - pain
  - list rules
  - list schedules
  - specify light color by HTML color codes
  - set light/group colors dynamically based on CPU load
  - pain
  - access firewalled bridge via SOCKS proxy
  - port scan to find offline (no call home) bridges on LAN
  - save config automatically
  - pain

I use this every day to ~~inflict pain upon myself~~ to control the lights inside and outside of my house.
